Record Collection
 
You are given a JSON object representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has several properties and a unique id number as its key. Not all albums have complete information.

Write a function updateRecords which takes an album's id (like 2548), a property prop (like "artist" or "tracks"), and a value (like "Addicted to Love") to modify the data in this collection.

Your function must always return the entire collection object.

There are several rules for handling incomplete data:

1.) If prop isn't "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), update or set the value for that record album's property.
2.) If prop is "tracks" but the album doesn't have a "tracks" property, create an empty array before adding the new value to the album's corresponding property.
3.) If prop is "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), push the value onto the end of the album's existing tracks array.
4.) If value is empty (""), delete the given prop property from the album.
